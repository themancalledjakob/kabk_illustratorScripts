## characterStyle
This script creates a new Document, and attaches a text.
Each character of the text is then given a font-size from small to big.

## characterStyleAdvanced
This script takes all the text in the current document and applies various character styles per letter.
Per character it applies a random font, random color, and interpolates rotation and font-size.

## noiseScale
This is a script from https://github.com/shspage/illustrator-scripts/

It is pretty advanced, and shows you even how to use a GUI.

This script requires "perlin-noise-simplex.js" by Sean McCullough.

The declaration on the first line assumes "perlin-noise-simplex.js" is placed under "lib" folder under "Scripts" folder of Adobe Illlustrator.

The file is also in this repository in the "lib" folder for your convenience.

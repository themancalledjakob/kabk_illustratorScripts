# Illustrator Scripts

## characterStyle
This script creates a new Document 

## noiseScale
This is a script from https://github.com/shspage/illustrator-scripts/

It is pretty advanced, and shows you even how to use a GUI.

This script requires "perlin-noise-simplex.js" by Sean McCullough.

https://gist.github.com/banksean/304522

The declaration on the first line assumes "perlin-noise-simplex.js" is placed under "lib" folder under "Scripts" folder of Adobe Illlustrator.

The file is also in this repository in the "lib" folder for your convenience.
